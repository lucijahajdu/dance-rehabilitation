                    After graduating from the Budapest School of Dance and the Madách Musical Dance School, I studied dance and rehearsal management at the Hungarian Dance Academy, and then I graduated from the MA programme of the college in 2014.
                    I have gained stage experience in several theatres in Budapest and Hungary, including the Weöres Sándor Theatre in Szombathely (2012 - Jungle Book, Sweet Charity), the Petőfi Theatre in Veszprém (2014, Chicago), the Jókai Theatre in Békéscsaba (Jungle Book).
                    In Budapest, I worked as a dancer at the Víg and Pesti Theatre (2009 - 2012, The Woman's Desire, Jungle Book, Fiddler on the Roof, Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors), at the Margaret Island Open Air Stage ( 2013, Twist Oliver), Belvárosi Színház ( 2015, Hair) and in a joint production with the Szeged Open Air Theatre of the Budapest Operetta Theatre
                    (2016, Singing in the Rain). In addition to my dance activities, I have also worked as an assistant choreographer to Johanna Bodor in several productions.
                    Between 2009 and 2011, I was on tour in Germany with the musical God's Money, where I also acted as dance captain.
                    Currently, I am the assistant choreographer for Lady Budapest at the Budapest Operetta Theatre, the Princess of Chicago and the Ének az esőben and choreographer of tap dance for the musical Nutcracker and Mouse King at the Jókai Theatre in Békéscsaba.
                    and the Egger's Egg and the Mouse.
                    Teaching experience at the Noverre Foundation Studio of the Hungarian Dance Academy (2012-2016), and at the Rottenbiller Street School of Dance (Talentum).
